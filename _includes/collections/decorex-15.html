Tex-tile was invited to participate in the Material Lab space as one of 14 luxury surface design studios.  For this exhibition we presented two new tiles, 'Skiathos' and 'Mesh' in the anthracite grey tone of the pallet.  'Skiathos' has an embroidered textile relief which is based on traditional weave patterns from the island of Skiathos, Greece.  'Mesh' was conceived as a modernist plan, in which the different materials and relief bring out the contrasting nuances of the glaze.
