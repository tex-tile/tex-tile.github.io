The 2011 Collection is inspired by designs of traditional Portuguese tiles (‘Azueljos’), which have been pixelated and abstracted to create the Collection. The moulds were made with either laser-cut felt or with laser-cut acrylic. The names of the tiles are those of different neighbourhoods in Lisbon, and these names are matched to tiles by correlating the urban intensity of these areas with that of the tile structure.
