This is a bespoke project for a recently refurbished early 20th century building in 14eme.  The tiles were cut into three elements â€“ with a central element comprising the wider core, and two thin slabs from either side of the core. The application of this design is a prelude to the Kensington project, but the design itself was originally conceived for Kensington. The kitchen is viewable from the living room, and the tiles are noticeable from a distance due to the distinct contours of the tiles, which are made more apparent by shadows when illuminated by light.
