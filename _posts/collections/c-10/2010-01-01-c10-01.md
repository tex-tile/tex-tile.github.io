The 2010 Collection was made with lace moulds that belonged to my Norwegian grandmother. As a little girl she moved from Bergen to Lisbon and when I moved to London to study architecture I brought these with me. They were really the first tests of putting lace to clay, and I was astonished by the amount of detail left behind on the clay once the lace was peeled away. The collection is delicate and feminine and at the same time faithfully Portuguese.
