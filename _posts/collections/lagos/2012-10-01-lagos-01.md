These tex-tiles are for a concept store in Lagos, Nigeria, where design, fashion and art created by African artists are sold under the same roof. The tex-tiles for this project were based on three different themes inspired by Nigerian culture. Two tiles were designed for a café space in the store, which has both an internal and an external terrace space. The café-wall tile was designed based on fabric compositions from Nigerian batik designs, whilst the ceiling-tile was inspired by 9th Century Nigerian sculpture. The third design is for a conference room, which is a unit in the centre of the building and this tile is based on the famous Nigerian basket weaves to create a woven room.
