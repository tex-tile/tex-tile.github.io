The 2012 Collection is based on weaves using different materials, and exploring these weaves in both a positive and negative imprint. The texture left behind on the clay differs completely depending on the material used for the weave, be it an organic rope such as jute or a man-made material such as rubber. Another aspect that has been challenged is the size of the tile, which has also been increased to fit the longer weaves, creating 16X14 tiles. Searching for the perfect tile size and shape is an ongoing study. The 16X14 tiles have then also been broken into smaller units so as to explore different rhythms in composition.
