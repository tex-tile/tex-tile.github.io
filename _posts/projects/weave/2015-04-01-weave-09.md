At Ventura Lambrate, tex-tile is using a rope tile that was initially designed for a derelict area in Lisbon called Mouraria.  The tile is composed of several ropes in a diagonal pattern creating a high positive contour tile.  When part of a composition of more of the same tiles, it creates a seemingly infinite pattern that is somehow broken and not symmetrical.  


Weave Constraints, a woven composition of four tiles, repeating the same tile design but in different colours and finishes, that seeks to find a marriage of colour and pattern.  This study shows that it is acceptable to blend variations in tone, but challenging to weave more striking differences in colour.  The white tiles contrast with the more subtle tonal variations delineating several weaves within the larger weave. Instead of using diagonal white tiles to delineate space, this study has chosen horizontal and vertical boundaries for the white tiles, as the weave pattern already carries a diagonal orientation.
