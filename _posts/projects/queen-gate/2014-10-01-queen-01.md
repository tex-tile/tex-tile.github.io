The project is for an existing client that has used the tiles in her property and is now using the tiles as a statement piece in her rental property. The rope tiles in a grey are used to cover the entrance of the apartment, creating a dramatic effect upon entering the space, setting a luxurious tone. The tiles are also used in the guest bathroom that leads off this space – in this case the tile is made from a leather stitch, and glazed in brown/green.
