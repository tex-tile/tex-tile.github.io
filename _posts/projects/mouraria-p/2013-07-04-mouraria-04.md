This is the design for a mural in downtown Lisbon in an area called Mouraria.  The project comprises a tiled panel for a degraded wall in a dilapidated pedestrian alley called ‘Beco do Rosendo’.  The aim is to bring the wall to life by adding light and texture and creating a space that can be used by the residents on warmer days.  The view onto the wall from the main street invites passers-by to come into the Beco.  The concept started with a workshop attended by residents from Mouraria.  This rope–tile design was inspired by images including: hanging laundry; ropes reminiscent of a fishing livelihood that characterised the neighborhood not so long ago; rhythmic patterns of shutters, and of crochet made by elderly lady residents - in summary, a collection of factors that inspired the individual scale of the tile and the larger scale of the mural pattern itself.

The tones of the tiles are light so as to make the space lighter than it currently is, and there is a subtle difference between the tones so as to add depth, complexity and attraction to the pattern.  The project is due for completion in Spring’14.
