This tex-tile project is for a family apartment, where the client is hugely interested in the arts and willing to explore quite unusual designs. The project was all based on one textile mould, which evolved to create a completely different final tile for the terrace and for the master bathroom. The same textile mould was used in a negative imprint for the terrace in a matt grey and subsequently used as a positive imprint for the master bathroom glazed in a pure white which appears slightly rosed in colour as the red colour of clay becomes visible below. The bathroom tile 16X14 was then broken into three units (two 2X16 and one 8X14) as the bathroom is in a round turret and a smaller tile unit better delineates the curvature of the space.
