Tex-tile has had tiles on display at Material Lab, shortly after our participation at Designjunction’13.  We were chosen to be part of the 'Making at Material Lab' for design week 2014, where chosen designers showcased innovative design processes.  It was a fantastic opportunity to lay out the total design process in one place and to explain to the public how the process links up to make the finished tile.
