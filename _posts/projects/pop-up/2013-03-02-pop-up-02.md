This is a collaborative venture for the pop-up store on Portobello Road, of the talented fashion designer Laura Figueras of Sur Studio.  The idea was to produce a wall piece that brought with it references of our southern heritage and of Surâ€™s Spring/Summer collection.  tex-tile created a blue piece called azulejo, reminiscent of long hot summers, which was composed in a hue of blues close to that of traditional Portuguese blue tiles.  The designs are a series of more delicate, lace and trimming fabric moulds woven into one.
